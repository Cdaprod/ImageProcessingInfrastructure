# Image Processing Project - TODO

## Overview

This project aims to develop an image processing application that uses serverless functions, a vector database, and a user interface for rapid prototyping and efficient similarity search. The project uses AWS Lambda, Milvus, Gradio, OpenCV, and Pillow.

## Tasks

### Setup and Configuration

- [ ] Set up Milvus server and configure connection settings
- [ ] Set up AWS Lambda and configure IAM roles and permissions
- [ ] Configure Docker and create an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository

### Image Processing

- [ ] Implement image processing function(s) in `app.py`
- [ ] Add necessary OpenCV or Pillow functions for desired processing techniques
- [ ] Test image processing functions using sample images

### Image Embeddings

- [ ] Choose and implement an image embedding generation method (e.g., pre-trained deep learning model)
- [ ] Implement the `create_and_store_embedding()` function in `app.py`
- [ ] Test embedding generation and storage using sample images

### Milvus Integration

- [ ] Implement Milvus client and connection in `app.py`
- [ ] Create necessary Milvus collections and partitions
- [ ] Test Milvus functionality with sample image embeddings
- [ ] Implement similarity search functions using Milvus

### Gradio Interface

- [ ] Implement Gradio interface for local testing and visualization
- [ ] Test Gradio interface with sample images and processing functions

### Deployment

- [ ] Package and deploy the image processing application using AWS Lambda and Docker
- [ ] Test the deployed image processing functions using various input images
- [ ] Monitor and optimize the performance of the deployed functions

### Documentation

- [ ] Document the image processing techniques and embedding generation methods
- [ ] Write a detailed README.md file for the repository
- [ ] Provide usage instructions and examples for the image processing application

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Evaluate and optimize the performance of image processing techniques
- [ ] Explore additional embedding generation methods for better similarity search
- [ ] Implement additional features or processing options based on user feedback
